CSC 207 Group Project

"Chronos" was developed with the intention of creating a flexible time manage-
ment tool that encourages goal accomplishment and enables for simple adjustment.
Chronos is designed for students who need assistance in striking and maintaining a
healthy work-life balance while remaining adaptable to changing situations.

Chronosâ€™ calendar system will meet this demand by enabling users to set up events
that can be modified later. Chronos will allow users to design prizes for themselves
that will only be "awarded" if specific events are fulfilled, further encouraging work-
life balance. This will help users remember to take time for themselves and prevent
burnout from relentlessly grinding.

Users will find Chronos useful since the project blends life-gamification and moti-
vational aspects with the schedule-making functionality of other applications like
Notion. Chronos will assist users in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and de-
veloping themselves along the way by merging the two aspects and generalising their
application to any issue like school or exercise.

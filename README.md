Chronos is a flexible time management tool designed to help students strike and maintain a healthy work-life balance while remaining adaptable to changing situations. By blending life-gamification and motivational aspects with schedule-making functionality, Chronos provides a unique approach to managing time effectively and achieving goals.

## Project Overview

**Chronos** was developed as a part of the CSC207 course project by "The Hamburglars" team.
